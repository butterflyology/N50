This is an R script to calculate N50 from the genome fasta file. This code is a combination of the code of many other researchers that I have pieced together to suit my needs. I have not kept records of those whose code I used, so if you think I have used your code and would like attribution, please let me know. - Chris Hamm (KU)

V 0.1 - Initial commit contains two basic function:
	o **data** which will output summary statistics for the genome
	o **plot** which uses the base graphics package to plot the genome contigs
